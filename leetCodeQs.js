// Purhcasing Supplies
// manufacturing company that provides customers with free containers to ship supplies. You have a cost of containers, an initial budget, a number of containers that need to be traded in for a free one.

// example:
// n(budget) = 4;
// cost= 1;
// m(free container) = 2; (trade 2, get 1 free)

// first buy 4 containers with the entire budget bc one container costs 1;

// 4 => 2 => 1
//  output = 7 (total num of containers used)

//  input:
//  n = 6;
//  cost = 2;
//  m = 2;

//  3 + 1 + 1 = 5
//  output = 5;
